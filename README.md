# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Cleaned and transformed transactional data using pandas and NumPy, eliminating 100% of null values and ensuring
consistency for model training.
• Designed an Autoencoder-based deep learning model to identify fraudulent transactions within a dataset of over
400,000 financial records, effectively learning hidden patterns to distinguish anomalies from normal behavior..
• Achieved 97.99% training accuracy and 97.96% test accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities, demonstrating high
model performance in an unsupervised learning setup.
• Implemented the solution in Python using PyTorch, optimizing an Autoencoder with a custom loss function to
enhance fraud detection accuracy.
